# cSID portability modifications

Based on [cSID](http://csdb.dk/release/?id=153597) and [cSID-light](http://csdb.dk/release/?id=156587) by [Hermit](http://hermit.sidrip.com/)

## Y U DO TIS?

I wanted a SID player for a hack project, and cSID looked small and nice, but the code was [a bit](https://github.com/possan/csid-mod/blob/master/original/cSID/csid.c#L75) hairy [at places](https://github.com/possan/csid-mod/blob/master/original/cSID/csid.c#L186), so i though i'd try to clean it up a bit.
